<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">Credit control and bad debts</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Credit control and managing bad debts are essential aspects of financial management for businesses. Here are some key points to consider regarding credit control and handling bad debts:</span></p>
<ol style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Credit control policies</span><span class="rvts6">: Establishing robust credit control policies and procedures is crucial. This involves assessing the creditworthiness of customers before extending credit, setting appropriate credit limits, and defining payment terms and conditions.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Credit checks</span><span class="rvts6">: Conducting credit checks on potential customers can help assess their financial stability and credit history. This information assists in determining whether to grant credit and the appropriate credit limit.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Clear terms and conditions</span><span class="rvts6">: Clearly communicate your payment terms and conditions to customers upfront. This includes specifying credit periods, penalties for late payments, and any applicable interest charges.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Invoicing and Statements</span><span class="rvts6">: Timely and accurate invoicing is essential to ensure prompt payment. Regularly send account statements to customers to keep them informed of their outstanding balances.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Payment reminders</span><span class="rvts6">: Implement a systematic process for sending payment reminders to customers as payment due dates approach. This can be done through automated reminders or personalized communications.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Debt collection</span><span class="rvts6">: If customers fail to make payments within the agreed terms, initiate a structured debt collection process. This may involve sending reminder letters, making phone calls, or engaging a debt collection agency if necessary.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Provision for Bad Debts</span><span class="rvts6">: Estimate and allocate provisions for bad debts based on the likelihood of non-payment. This helps account for potential losses and maintains accurate financial reporting.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Write-offs</span><span class="rvts6">: When it becomes clear that a debt is uncollectible, it may need to be written off as a bad debt. Proper documentation and accounting entries should be made to reflect this.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Legal options</span><span class="rvts6">: In extreme cases where all collection efforts fail, legal action may be pursued to recover outstanding debts. Consult legal professionals to explore available options.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Regular review</span><span class="rvts6">: Continuously monitor and review your credit control processes and performance. Identify areas for improvement and implement necessary adjustments to minimize bad debts.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Effective credit control practices can help mitigate the risk of bad debts and maintain healthy cash flow. Regular monitoring, proactive communication, and diligent follow-up are crucial in managing credit effectively and minimizing the impact of bad debts on your business.</span></p>

  <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)</span><span class="rvts6">: Adhere to the provisions of the FCRA, which governs the collection, dissemination, and use of consumer credit information, ensuring compliance with consumer rights and privacy.</span></li>
  <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA)</span><span class="rvts6">: Comply with the ECOA, which prohibits discrimination based on race, colour, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, or receipt of public assistance when evaluating credit applications.</span></li>

It is advisable to establish clear credit policies and procedures, conduct thorough credit assessments, and regularly monitor the creditworthiness of customers to manage credit risks effectively.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">Open item feature versus the balance brought forward - Advantages to manage debtor accounts to reduce bad debts</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Managing debtor accounts using the Open Item feature can offer advantages in reducing bad debts. Here's how it can help:</span></p>
<ol style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Improved accuracy</span><span class="rvts6">: With the Open Item feature, each transaction is treated as a separate item or entry. This allows for precise tracking of individual invoices and payments. By accurately matching payments to specific invoices, you can identify any outstanding balances more easily, ensuring that debts are promptly addressed.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Enhanced visibility</span><span class="rvts6">: The Open Item feature provides a clear overview of each debtor's account, showing all outstanding invoices and payments. This visibility enables you to identify overdue invoices and take appropriate actions, such as sending reminders or initiating collection efforts promptly.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Proactive credit control</span><span class="rvts6">: By regularly reviewing open items and following up with debtors, you can maintain better control over credit terms and ensure timely payments. Promptly addressing any discrepancies or disputes can help prevent bad debts from accumulating.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Accurate ageing analysis</span><span class="rvts6">: The Open Item feature enables accurate ageing analysis of outstanding invoices. By categorizing debts based on their ageing periods (e.g., current, 30 days, 60 days, etc.), you can identify problematic accounts or overdue payments more effectively. This analysis helps in prioritising collections and taking necessary actions to recover outstanding amounts.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Prompt dispute resolution</span><span class="rvts6">: The detailed tracking provided by the Open Item feature facilitates faster resolution of invoice disputes. By promptly addressing and resolving any discrepancies or disputes, you can minimise the risk of bad debts arising from unresolved issues.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Overall, the Open Item feature offers greater control and visibility over debtor accounts, helping you proactively manage credit control and reduce the occurrence of bad debts.

</ol>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">By printing this report, you can have an overview of the credit limits, current balances, and available balances for your debtors. This information can help you monitor credit utilisation, identify potential risks, and make informed decisions regarding credit extensions and debt management.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Remember to review the report regularly and take appropriate actions based on the information provided to maintain healthy debtor accounts and minimize credit-related issues.</span></p>
<h2 class="rvps4"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts11">Available balances in documents - Messages</span></span></h2>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">In osFinancials, when processing sales documents such as quotes, invoices, and credit notes, the available balances (credit limit minus current balance) are shown in the document entry footer section. When you complete the document and click </span><span class="rvts14">OK</span><span class="rvts6">, a warning message may appear if the debtor's balance exceeds the credit limit. The warning message will indicate the amount by which the balance exceeds the credit limit, such as&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts17">"Debtor's balance is over credit limit with: -1100."</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">This warning message serves as an alert to inform you that the debtor's outstanding balance has exceeded the predefined credit limit. It indicates that the debtor may have exceeded their credit terms or credit limit, and you may need to review their account and take appropriate actions, such as contacting the debtor to arrange payment or adjusting their credit limit.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">It's important to address these warnings and take necessary steps to manage credit risks and ensure timely payment from debtors. This helps maintain healthy cash flow and minimizes the potential for bad debts or financial difficulties for your business.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">Messages to enhance credit control&nbsp;</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">In osFinancials, you can utilize messages to enhance credit control practices. Here are some relevant features:</span></p>

 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Messages on Debtor statements</span><span class="rvts6">: Within the </span><span class="rvts14">Setup → </span><a class="rvts32" href="documents-setup.html">Documents setup</a><span class="rvts6"> - </span><a class="rvts32" href="documents-setup-statements-setup.html">Statements</a><span class="rvts6"> tab, you can enter a global message that will be printed on all debtor statements.

</ol>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">By utilizing these message features in osFinancials, you can effectively communicate with your debtors, provide important information, and reinforce credit control measures. These messages serve as reminders, prompts, or additional notes on various documents and statements, enhancing your credit control practices.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">Calendar - Appointments and notes</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Calendar - If you need to review a credit limit or have some concerns, you may schedule up to six categories of appointments with debtors in the </span><a class="rvts32" href="calendar-planner.html">Calendar</a><span class="rvts6">. On these appointments, you may add notes about the intended reason for the appointment and discussions. This feature allows you to effectively manage and review credit limits, address concerns, and track important discussions with debtors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">By utilising the calendar feature, you can effectively manage your debtor-related appointments and stay on top of credit limit reviews and other important discussions. The ability to add notes and set reminders enhances your ability to track and follow up on these appointments, ensuring efficient debtor management.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">A list and detailed information of all appointments, including any notes, can be accessed on the </span><a class="rvts32" href="debtor-tab-appointments.html">Appointment</a><span class="rvts6"> tab of a selected debtor account in osFinancials.

<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">Disable debtor accounts</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Disable debtor accounts - In osFinancials, if you have written off bad debts for a debtor and consider them to be a credit risk, you have the option to disable their debtor account. By selecting the "</span><span class="rvts15">Account disabled</span><span class="rvts6">" option on the </span><a class="rvts33" href="debtor-tab-accounting-info.html">Accounting information</a><span class="rvts6"> tab, you can prevent any further processing and posting of transactions for that particular debtor.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">By setting a debtor account as inactive or disabling a debtor account, you ensure that no further transactions can be processed or posted for that specific debtor. This helps in managing credit risks and preventing additional financial exposure. However, it's important to note that all existing transactions and historical data related to the debtor will still be available in reports and other relevant areas of the osFinancials system.</span><span class="rvts6"></span></p>
