<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">Accrued income / Outstanding income / Income receivable : Accounting standards and Accounting method</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Accrued income, also referred to as outstanding income or income receivable, is applicable to both small and medium entities (SMEs) and larger entities following IFRS (full) or IFRS for SMEs. The recognition and treatment of accrued income are generally consistent across these frameworks.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Under IFRS (full), accrued income is recognized as an asset and is accounted for using the accrual basis of accounting. It represents revenue that has been earned but not yet received in cash or its equivalent. This typically occurs when goods or services have been provided to customers, but the payment is not yet due or has not been received. Accrued income is recognized to reflect the economic benefit that the entity has earned.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Similarly, under IFRS for SMEs, there are specific provisions for the recognition, measurement, and presentation of accrued income. The standard provides guidance on when accrued income should be recognized as an asset and how it should be measured. The disclosure requirements may also differ from IFRS (full), tailored to the needs of SMEs.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Regarding the accounting method, the treatment of accrued income would also differ between the cash basis and accrual basis of accounting. Under the cash basis, income is recognized when cash is received, and therefore, accrued income would not be applicable. In contrast, under the accrual basis, accrued income is recognized as an asset even if cash has not been received yet, based on the concept of earning revenue.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">It's important to note that the recognition and measurement of accrued income may vary based on the specific circumstances and industry practices. It's advisable to consult the applicable accounting standards and guidelines, as well as any specific requirements or interpretations for your jurisdiction and entity, to ensure proper treatment and disclosure of accrued income based on the chosen accounting framework.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">What is Accrued income / Outstanding income?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Accrued (outstanding) income refers to income that has been earned by a business but has not yet been received or recorded as revenue. It represents the amount of income that is due to the business for goods sold or services rendered but for which the payment has not been received.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Accrued income typically arises when a business follows the accrual basis of accounting, which recognises revenue when it is earned, regardless of when the payment is actually received. This means that even if the payment for a sale or service is expected to be received in the future, the revenue is still recognized in the period when it was earned.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Examples of accrued income include:</span></p>
<ol style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Services rendered but not yet billed</span><span class="rvts6">: If a business provides services to a customer but has not yet issued an invoice for those services, the income earned from those services would be considered accrued income.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Rent or interest income</span><span class="rvts6">: If a business owns rental properties or lends money and the payment for rent or interest is due at the end of the month or at a later date, the income for that period would be accrued until the payment is received.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Sales made on credit</span><span class="rvts6">: When a business sells goods or services on credit, meaning the customer is allowed to pay at a later date, the revenue from those sales is recognized as accrued income until the payment is received.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Accrued income is recorded as a current asset on the balance sheet until it is received. It represents the right to receive payment for goods sold or services rendered. Once the payment is received, the accrued income is reversed, and the corresponding revenue is recorded.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">What is the batch type for accrued (outstanding) income?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Accrual or year-end adjustments are typically recorded in the general journal. The general journal is a catch-all journal where transactions that do not fit into specific specialised journals are recorded.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">While it is possible to create a separate batch or journal type such as "</span><span class="rvts15">Adjustments</span><span class="rvts6">" specifically for accrual or year-end adjustments, it is not a common practice. The general journal is often used for such adjustments as it allows for flexibility in recording various types of transactions and adjustments that may arise during the accounting period.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">What is the journal entries for accrued (outstanding) income?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">To record the adjustment for accrued (outstanding) income, follow these steps:</span></p>
<ol style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Identify the income that has been earned but not yet received</span><span class="rvts6">: Review your records and identify any income that has been earned during the accounting period but has not yet been received or recorded as revenue.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Create an Accrued income account</span><span class="rvts6">: Establish a liability account in your chart of accounts called "</span><span class="rvts15">Accrued Income</span><span class="rvts6">" or a similar name. Assign it a suitable account number based on your accounting system's numbering convention.</span></li>

   <p class="rvps12"><span class="rvts37">Sub-accounts</span><span class="rvts40">: It is advisable to create a main account called "Accrued Income" in the current asset section of the balance sheet. This main account can serve as a summary account to track all accrued income amounts that are yet to be received or invoiced.</span></p>
   <p class="rvps12"><span class="rvts40">Under the "Accrued Income" main account, you can create sub-accounts to categorize specific types of accrued income. For example, you can create sub-accounts for "Sales in Advance," "Rent Received in Advance," or any other specific types of accrued income relevant to your business.</span></p>
   <p class="rvps12"><span class="rvts40">By using sub-accounts, you can provide more detailed information about the nature and source of the accrued income. It allows for better organization and tracking of the various sources of accrued income within the overall "Accrued Income" category.</span></p>
   <p class="rvps12"><span class="rvts40">Creating sub-accounts helps in presenting a clear and comprehensive view of your accrued income in the balance sheet. It also facilitates easier analysis and monitoring of the different types of accrued income and their impact on the financial position of the business.</span></p>
   <p class="rvps12"><span class="rvts40">Remember to consult with an accounting professional or refer to accounting standards specific to your jurisdiction to ensure accurate and compliant reporting of accrued income in your financial statements.</span></p>
