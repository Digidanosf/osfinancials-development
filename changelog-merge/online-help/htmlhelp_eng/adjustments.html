            <div class="main-content">
                
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">What is year-end adjustments?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Year-end adjustments, also known as adjusting entries, are accounting entries made at the end of an accounting period to ensure that a business's financial statements accurately reflect its financial position and performance.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">These adjustments are necessary because certain transactions may not have been recorded or may have been recorded incorrectly during the accounting period. Year-end adjustments are made to correct these errors and to recognize revenues and expenses in the appropriate accounting period.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Year-end adjustments may include accruals for expenses and revenues that have been incurred but not yet recorded, such as salaries and wages, interest, and rent. They may also include adjustments for prepaid expenses, such as insurance or rent, that have been paid in advance.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Depreciation adjustments may also be made for fixed assets that have been in use during the accounting period. In addition, adjusting entries may be made to correct errors in previously recorded transactions, such as incorrect account balances or misclassified expenses.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Year-end adjustments are an important part of the accounting process and are necessary for accurate financial reporting. They ensure that a business's financial statements reflect its true financial position and performance for the accounting period.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">What is the difference between the cash based and accrual based accounting?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Cash basis accounting and accrual basis accounting are two methods used to keep track of a business's financial transactions.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">In cash basis accounting, revenue and expenses are recognized only when money is actually received or paid out. This means that income is recognized only when cash is received and expenses are recorded only when they are actually paid.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">On the other hand, accrual basis accounting recognizes revenue when it is earned, regardless of whether payment has been received, and expenses when they are incurred, regardless of whether payment has been made. This means that revenue is recognized when the product or service is delivered, and expenses are recognized when the goods or services are received.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">For example, let's say a company provides services to a client in January but does not receive payment until February. Under the cash basis accounting method, the revenue would be recognized in February when payment is received. However, under the accrual basis accounting method, the revenue would be recognized in January when the services were provided.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The choice between cash basis accounting and accrual basis accounting depends on the specific needs and goals of the business. Cash basis accounting is simpler and easier to maintain, while accrual basis accounting provides a more accurate picture of a business's financial position over time.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">Do the cash based accounting need any adjustments?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">While cash basis accounting is simpler than accrual basis accounting, it may still require adjustments.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">One common adjustment needed is for accounts receivable and accounts payable. In cash basis accounting, revenue is recognized when cash is received and expenses are recognized when cash is paid. However, if a business has accounts receivable or accounts payable, there may be revenue or expenses that have been earned or incurred but have not yet been paid or received.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">To adjust for this, a business using cash basis accounting may need to make adjustments for accruals, deferrals, and other adjustments. For example, if a business has earned revenue but has not yet received payment, an adjusting entry would be made to recognize the revenue and increase accounts receivable.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Other adjustments may include the recognition of prepaid expenses or unearned revenue, as well as the recognition of accrued expenses or revenue. These adjustments can help ensure that a business's financial statements accurately reflect its financial position and performance.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">It's important to note that while adjustments may be needed for cash basis accounting, they are generally simpler and less frequent than those required for accrual basis accounting.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">What is the types for adjustments of accrual bases accounting?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">There are several types of adjustments that may be required for accrual basis accounting. Some common types of adjustments include:</span></p>
<ol style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Accrued expenses</span><span class="rvts6">: Accrued expenses are expenses that have been incurred but have not yet been paid. An adjusting entry is made to recognize these expenses and to increase the corresponding liability account.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Accrued revenue</span><span class="rvts6">: Accrued revenue is revenue that has been earned but has not yet been received. An adjusting entry is made to recognize this revenue and to increase the corresponding asset account.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Prepaid expenses</span><span class="rvts6">: Prepaid expenses are expenses that have been paid in advance. An adjusting entry is made to recognize the portion of the expense that has been used and to decrease the corresponding asset account.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Unearned revenue</span><span class="rvts6">: Unearned revenue is revenue that has been received in advance. An adjusting entry is made to recognize the portion of the revenue that has been earned and to decrease the corresponding liability account.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Depreciation</span><span class="rvts6">: Depreciation is the process of allocating the cost of a long-term asset over its useful life. An adjusting entry is made to recognize the portion of the asset's cost that has been used up and to decrease the corresponding asset account.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">These adjustments ensure that a business's financial statements accurately reflect its financial position and performance. They also help to ensure that revenue and expenses are recognized in the correct accounting period.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">What journal types is used to process adjustments?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Accrual or year-end adjustments are typically recorded in the general journal. The general journal is a catch-all journal where transactions that do not fit into specific specialised journals are recorded.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">While it is possible to create a separate journal type such as "</span><span class="rvts15">Adjustments</span><span class="rvts6">" specifically for accrual or year-end adjustments, it is not a common practice. The general journal is often used for such adjustments as it allows for flexibility in recording various types of transactions and adjustments that may arise during the accounting period.</span></p>

   <p class="rvps12"><span class="rvts40">However, in osFinancials5 you may create a specific batch or journal type in </span><span class="rvts37">Setup → </span><a class="rvts38" href="batch-types-setup.html">Batch types</a><span class="rvts40"> menu on the </span><span class="rvts37">Setup</span><span class="rvts40"> ribbon depending on the company's internal accounting procedures. You may configure the settings for the batch (journal) to meet your specific requirements.&nbsp;</span></p>
   <p class="rvps12"><span class="rvts40">Creating a separate journal type such as "Adjustments" in osFinancials5 can be a useful approach to segregate and control the processing of adjustment transactions.&nbsp;</span></p>
   <p class="rvps12"><span class="rvts40">Using an "Adjustments" journal type and configuring the batch settings can indeed help minimize errors and streamline the tracking and reporting of adjustment entries in osFinancials5. By setting up specific batch settings for the "Adjustments" journal type, you can customise the behaviour and attributes of the batch. This includes defining default accounts, specifying required fields, setting validation rules, and enabling specific features that align with your adjustment entry process.</span></p>
   <p class="rvps12"><span class="rvts40">Configuring the batch settings for adjustments can help enforce consistency and accuracy in recording adjustment transactions. For example, you can ensure that all required fields are correctly entered before a transaction is posted to the ledger, reducing the likelihood of missing or incomplete information. You can also set up validation rules to validate the data entered in certain fields, preventing entry errors.</span></p>
   <p class="rvps12"><span class="rvts40">Furthermore, by having a designated journal type for adjustments, you can easily generate specific batch type reports that focus solely on adjustment transactions. These reports can provide a consolidated view of all adjustment entries, making it easier to review, analyse, and reconcile the adjustments made during a specific period.</span></p>
   <p class="rvps12"><span class="rvts40">Additionally, the ability to search and filter specific adjustment transactions within the Set of Books can be beneficial for tracking and auditing purposes. You can use the search and filter functionality to narrow down the displayed transactions to only those categorized as adjustments. This helps isolate and review the adjustment entries separately, providing better visibility and control over the adjustment process.</span></p>
   <p class="rvps12"><span class="rvts40">Overall, by leveraging an "Adjustments" journal type and configuring the batch settings in osFinancials5, you can enhance accuracy, streamline reporting, and improve the management of adjustment transactions within your accounting system.</span></p>

This allows you to define the appropriate restrictions and permissions for each user, ensuring that adjustments are recorded and managed by designated individuals.</span></p>
   <p class="rvps12"><span class="rvts40">Additionally, the ability to block selected accounts from posting can further enhance control over the adjustment process. By blocking specific accounts, you can restrict users from posting to those accounts, maintaining the integrity of the financial data and ensuring accurate recording of accrued income and other adjustments.</span></p>
   <p class="rvps12"><span class="rvts40">It is important to align these practices with your organisation's internal accounting procedures and consult with accounting professionals to ensure compliance with accounting standards and best practices.</span></p>
