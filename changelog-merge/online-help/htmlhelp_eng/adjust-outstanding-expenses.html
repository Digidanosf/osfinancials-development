<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">Accrued expenses / Outstanding expenses : Accounting standards and Accounting method</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The concept of accrued expenses, also known as outstanding expenses, is applicable to both small and medium entities (SMEs) and larger entities following IFRS (full) or IFRS for SMEs. The treatment of accrued expenses is generally consistent across the two frameworks.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Under IFRS (full), accrued expenses are recognized as liabilities and are accounted for using the accrual basis of accounting. Accrued expenses represent expenses that have been incurred but not yet paid or recorded in the financial statements. Examples of accrued expenses include salaries payable, utility bills accrued but not yet paid, or interest payable on outstanding loans. These expenses are recognized as liabilities and are subsequently recorded as expenses when they are incurred, even if payment has not been made.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Under IFRS for SMEs, there are specific provisions for the recognition, measurement, and presentation of accrued expenses. The standard provides guidance on how to account for accrued expenses, including when they should be recognized as liabilities and how they should be measured. The disclosure requirements may also differ from IFRS (full), being more streamlined and tailored to the needs of SMEs.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Regarding the accounting method (cash basis or accrual basis), the treatment of accrued expenses would generally be different. The cash basis of accounting recognizes expenses and liabilities only when cash is paid or received, and therefore, accrued expenses would not be recorded as liabilities under the cash basis. In contrast, under the accrual basis of accounting, accrued expenses are recognized as liabilities when the expenses are incurred, even if the payment has not yet been made.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">It's important to consult the specific accounting standards and guidelines applicable to your jurisdiction and entity to ensure proper treatment and disclosure of accrued expenses based on the chosen accounting framework.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">What is Accrued expenses / Outstanding expenses?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Accrued expenses, also known as outstanding expenses, refer to expenses that have been incurred by a business but have not yet been paid or recorded in the accounting records. These expenses are recognised and recorded in the period in which they are incurred, even if the payment is due at a later date.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Examples of accrued expenses include:</span></p>
<ol style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Salaries and wages</span><span class="rvts6">: If employees have worked for a certain period but have not yet been paid, their salaries and wages would be considered as accrued expenses.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Utilities</span><span class="rvts6">: If the business has consumed utilities such as electricity, water, or gas but has not yet received the bill or made the payment, the expenses would be accrued.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Rent</span><span class="rvts6">: If rent is due at the end of the month but the payment has not yet been made, the rent expense would be accrued.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Interest</span><span class="rvts6">: If the business has borrowed money and the interest expense has accrued but has not yet been paid, it would be recorded as an accrued expense.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Taxes</span><span class="rvts6">: If the business has incurred taxes but the payment is due at a later date, the taxes would be considered as accrued expenses.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Accrued expenses are recorded as a liability on the balance sheet, indicating the amount owed by the business. The corresponding entry is made in the expense account on the income statement to recognize the expense for the period.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">By recording accrued expenses, the financial statements provide a more accurate representation of the expenses incurred during a particular period, even if the cash outflow has not occurred yet. It ensures that the financial statements reflect the true financial position and performance of the business.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">Adjustments - Accrued expenses / Outstanding expenses - how would this be recorded?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">"</span><span class="rvts15">Adjustments - Accrued expenses / Outstanding expenses</span><span class="rvts6">" refers to the process of recording and adjusting the financial transactions related to expenses that have been incurred but not yet paid or recorded in the current accounting period. It involves recognising the expenses in the income statement and creating a corresponding liability on the balance sheet to reflect the amount owed for these outstanding expenses.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Accrued expenses or outstanding expenses are liabilities that arise when a business incurs expenses but has not yet paid for them. These expenses are typically recorded and recognised in the period in which they are incurred, regardless of when the actual payment occurs. By accruing the expenses, the financial statements provide a more accurate representation of the expenses for the given period.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The "</span><span class="rvts15">Adjustments - Accrued expenses / Outstanding expenses</span><span class="rvts6">" entry is used to adjust the accounts and reflect the unpaid expenses. The adjustment is made by debiting the respective expense accounts to recognize the expense in the income statement and crediting the Accrued expenses or Outstanding expenses account to record the liability.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">This adjustment is necessary to ensure that the financial statements accurately reflect the expenses incurred and the corresponding liabilities as of the end of the accounting period. It helps in providing a more complete and accurate picture of the business's financial position and performance.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts14">To record the adjustment for accrued expenses or outstanding expenses, follow these steps</span><span class="rvts6">:</span></p>
<ol style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Identify the accrued expenses</span><span class="rvts6">: Determine the expenses that have been incurred but not yet paid as of the end of the accounting period. These expenses could include salaries, utilities, rent, interest, or any other expenses that are recognized but unpaid.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Create an Accrued expenses account</span><span class="rvts6">: Establish a liability account in your chart of accounts called "Accrued expenses" or "Outstanding expenses." Assign it a suitable account number based on your accounting system's numbering convention. This account will track the amount owed for the accrued expenses.</span></li>

It provides a structured approach to track and categorize different types of accrued expenses or outstanding expenses.</span></p>
   <p class="rvps12"><span class="rvts40">By creating sub-accounts, you can better classify and differentiate the sources of accrued expenses or outstanding expenses. This allows for more detailed reporting and analysis of the specific types of accrued expenses or outstanding expenses, such as subscriptions, salaries and wages, interest, rent, or any other relevant categories for your business.</span></p>
   <p class="rvps12"><span class="rvts40">Using sub-accounts also enhances the clarity and transparency of your financial statements. It helps stakeholders understand the composition and magnitude of the accrued expenses or outstanding expenses and its impact on the overall financial position of the business.</span></p>
   <p class="rvps12"><span class="rvts40">When creating sub-accounts, it is important to follow accounting standards and guidelines applicable to your jurisdiction.

<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">Treatment of Accrued expenses (Outstanding expenses) in the new financial year?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">In the new financial year, the treatment of accrued expenses or outstanding expenses depends on the specific circumstances and accounting policies of the business. Here are some common approaches:</span></p>
<ol style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Reverse the previous year's accrual</span><span class="rvts6">: If an expense was accrued at the end of the previous financial year but has not yet been paid, it may be appropriate to reverse the accrual entry in the new financial year. This is done by debiting the accrued expense account and crediting the corresponding expense account. By reversing the accrual, the expense is no longer recognized in the new financial year until the actual payment is made.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Record the actual payment</span><span class="rvts6">: When the accrued expense is eventually paid in the new financial year, you would record the payment by debiting the relevant expense account and crediting the cash or accounts payable account, depending on the payment method. This entry recognizes the expense in the new financial year and reduces the liability associated with the outstanding expense.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Adjust for any changes</span><span class="rvts6">: If there are any changes in the amount of the accrued expense or outstanding expense, adjustments should be made accordingly. For example, if the initial accrual was an estimate and the actual amount paid differs, an adjustment entry may be needed to reflect the correct expense amount.</span></li>

<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">Accrued expenses (Outstanding expenses) is this applicable to cash basis accounting method?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Accrued expenses, also known as outstanding expenses, are typically associated with the accrual basis accounting method rather than the cash basis accounting method.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">In accrual accounting, expenses are recognised when they are incurred, regardless of when the payment is made. This means that even if the payment for an expense has not been made yet, it is still recognized as an expense in the accounting period in which it was incurred. Accrued expenses represent expenses that have been incurred but not yet paid.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">On the other hand, the cash basis accounting method recognizes expenses only when the actual payment is made. With the cash basis, expenses are recorded when the cash outflow occurs, rather than when the expense is incurred. Therefore, accrued expenses are not applicable to the cash basis accounting method since expenses are not recognized until the cash payment is made.</span></p>

   <p class="rvps12"><span class="rvts40">It's important to choose the appropriate accounting method (either accrual basis or cash basis) based on the nature and size of your business, as well as any legal or regulatory requirements. Generally, larger businesses and entities are required to use the accrual basis accounting method, while smaller businesses may opt for the cash basis method for simplicity and ease of recording transactions.</span></p>
