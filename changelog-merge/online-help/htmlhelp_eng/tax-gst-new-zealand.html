            <h2>Goods and Services Tax (GST) - New Zealand</h2>

            <div class="main-content">
                
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">Goods and Services Tax (GST) in New Zealand</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">As of ChatGPT's last update in September 2021, New Zealand applies a Goods and Services Tax (GST). The GST is a broad-based consumption tax levied on the supply of most goods, services, and other items in New Zealand.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Here are some key points about the GST in New Zealand:</span></p>
<ol style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">GST Rate</span><span class="rvts6">: The standard GST rate in New Zealand is 15%. This means that when consumers purchase most goods and services, they pay an additional 15% of the purchase price as GST.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Taxable Supplies</span><span class="rvts6">: The GST applies to most goods and services supplied by businesses, including sales of goods, services, imports, and certain intangible supplies. Some supplies may be GST-exempt, meaning GST is not charged on them, or they may be zero-rated, in which case they are subject to GST at a 0% rate.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">GST Registration</span><span class="rvts6">: Businesses with an annual turnover of NZD 60,000 or more are required to register for GST with the Inland Revenue Department (IRD). Once registered, businesses must charge GST on their taxable supplies and can claim input tax credits for the GST paid on their business expenses.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">GST Returns</span><span class="rvts6">: Registered businesses must file regular GST returns with the IRD, typically on a bi-monthly, six-monthly, or annual basis, depending on their GST turnover. The GST returns report the GST collected (output tax) and GST paid on expenses (input tax). The net amount is either remitted to the IRD or refunded.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Input Tax Credits</span><span class="rvts6">: Registered businesses can claim input tax credits for the GST they have paid on their business expenses. This allows businesses to offset the GST they pay on purchases against the GST they collect on sales, resulting in a net GST liability or refund.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">GST on Imported Goods and Services</span><span class="rvts6">: Goods and services imported into New Zealand are generally subject to GST. For low-value imported goods (valued up to NZD 1,000), offshore suppliers may be required to register for and collect GST on behalf of the New Zealand Customs Service.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">GST on Digital Services</span><span class="rvts6">: As of October 1, 2016, non-resident suppliers of digital services (e.g., streaming services, software downloads) to New Zealand consumers are required to register for and charge GST on these services.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">It's important for businesses operating in New Zealand to understand and comply with the GST regulations, including registration, reporting, and remittance requirements. As tax laws can change, businesses should consult with the Inland Revenue Department or tax professionals for the most up-to-date information regarding the GST in New Zealand.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">Is there any GST Schemes in New Zealand?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Yes, there are several Goods and Services Tax (GST) schemes in New Zealand. These schemes are designed to simplify GST reporting for specific types of businesses and transactions. The main GST schemes in New Zealand include:</span></p>
<ol style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Standard GST Scheme</span><span class="rvts6">: This is the standard GST scheme that applies to most businesses in New Zealand. Under this scheme, businesses charge GST on their sales (output GST) and claim GST on their purchases (input GST). GST returns are usually filed on a regular basis, either monthly, two-monthly, or six-monthly, depending on the business's turnover.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Payments Basis Scheme</span><span class="rvts6">: Businesses with an annual turnover of less than NZD $2 million can opt for the payments basis scheme. Under this scheme, businesses only account for GST when they receive payment for their sales or when they make payments for their purchases. This can help with cash flow management for small businesses.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Invoice Basis Scheme</span><span class="rvts6">: This is the default scheme for businesses with an annual turnover of NZD $24 million or more. Under this scheme, GST is accounted for when an invoice is issued or received, regardless of whether payment has been made. Most larger businesses in New Zealand use this scheme.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Hybrid Basis Scheme</span><span class="rvts6">: Some businesses may use a hybrid of the payments basis and invoice basis schemes. This means they account for GST on a payments basis for some transactions and on an invoice basis for others.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Non-Residents GST Scheme</span><span class="rvts6">: This scheme applies to non-resident businesses that make taxable supplies in New Zealand. Non-resident businesses are required to register for GST under this scheme if they exceed the registration threshold for non-residents.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Margin Scheme</span><span class="rvts6">: The margin scheme is applicable to certain transactions involving land or other specified assets. Under this scheme, GST is calculated based on the margin (the difference between the selling price and the purchase price) rather than the full selling price.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Tourist Refund Scheme (TRS)</span><span class="rvts6">: The TRS allows tourists and visitors to New Zealand to claim a refund of GST paid on goods purchased in New Zealand, subject to certain conditions.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">It's important for businesses to select the most appropriate GST scheme based on their turnover, the nature of their transactions, and their cash flow requirements. Businesses are advised to seek guidance from accounting professionals or tax advisors to determine the best GST scheme for their specific circumstances.</span></p>

<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">In the Chart of Accounts for businesses in New Zealand, Goods and Services Tax (GST) accounts are structured to accurately record and report GST-related transactions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2 class="rvps4"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts11">Standard GST Scheme</span></span></h2>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The structure of GST accounts for the Standard GST Scheme may vary depending on the size and complexity of the business, but here is a common framework:</span></p>

<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">It's important to note that the above structure is a general framework, and businesses may have additional sub-accounts or variations based on their specific needs and the complexity of their GST transactions.

<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">In New Zealand, the Payments Basis Scheme is an alternative method of accounting for Goods and Services Tax (GST).

 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts6">Business Information: This includes the business name, IRD (Inland Revenue Department) number, and the GST registration status.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts6">Income: This section requires you to report the total value of taxable supplies (sales) made during the period.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts6">Expenses: Here, you declare the total value of GST-exclusive expenses incurred for business purposes during the period.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts6">Output Tax: This field is calculated automatically based on the sales made (Income) and the applicable GST rate.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts6">Input Tax: This field is calculated automatically based on the expenses claimed (Expenses) and the applicable GST rate.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts6">GST Payable (or Refundable): The difference between Output Tax and Input Tax will determine whether you owe GST to the IRD (GST Payable) or are eligible for a GST refund (GST Refundable).</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts6">Payments or Refunds: In this section, you will enter any additional tax payments made or GST refunds received during the return period.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts6">Other GST adjustments: Any adjustments to GST that need to be made, such as corrections for previous periods, should be included here.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts6">Final Amount Payable (or Refundable): This is the net amount of GST that you will need to pay to the IRD or that will be refunded to you.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">It's important to note that tax regulations can change over time, and there might have been updates or changes to the GST return in New Zealand since my last update. I recommend checking with the New Zealand Inland Revenue or a tax professional to get the most up-to-date and accurate information.</span><span class="rvts6"></span></p>
