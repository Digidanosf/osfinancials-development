            <div class="main-content">
                
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">What are Journals (Batches) and the Role of Source Documents?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Journals, also known as batches, are a fundamental concept in accounting. They refer to a chronological record of financial transactions that are systematically recorded in the accounting system. Journals serve as the initial entry point for capturing and documenting the details of each transaction before they are posted to the general ledger.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">One crucial aspect of maintaining accurate journals is the use of source documents. Source documents are original records or paperwork that provide concrete evidence of a financial transaction. These documents play a pivotal role in the accounting process, as they support and validate the entries made in journals. Here's how source documents fit into the journaling process:</span></p>
<ol style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Source Documents</span><span class="rvts6">: Whenever a financial transaction occurs, it generates a source document. These documents can take various forms, such as invoices, receipts, purchase orders, contracts, bank statements, and more. Source documents contain essential information about the transaction, including the parties involved, the date, the nature of the transaction, and the monetary amount.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Recording in Journals</span><span class="rvts6">: Accountants use these source documents as the basis for creating journal entries. Each transaction is meticulously recorded in the appropriate journal, ensuring that all relevant details from the source document are accurately transcribed. The columns in the journal capture key information, such as the date of the transaction, the accounts involved (debit and credit), a description of the transaction, and the monetary amount.&nbsp;</span></li>

   <p class="rvps12"><span class="rvts37">Types of Journals</span><span class="rvts40">:</span></p>
   <p class="rvps12"><span class="rvts40">Various types of journals exist, each designed for specific transaction types. Common examples include the Sales Journal, Purchases Journal, Cash Receipts Journal, Cash Payments Journal, and General Journal. Specialised journals may also be used for specific transactions, such as the Payroll journal or Inventory journal.</span></p>

 <li value="3" class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Batch Processing</span><span class="rvts6">: Entries within a journal are often processed and posted collectively as a batch. This batch processing approach helps streamline the accounting process and ensures that transactions are recorded accurately and efficiently. Batch processing is especially useful when dealing with a high volume of transactions.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Posting to the General Ledger</span><span class="rvts6">: After recording transactions in the appropriate journals, the entries, along with their supporting source documents, are transferred or posted to the general ledger. This step summarizes the journal entries and updates the account balances in the general ledger accounts.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Audit Trail</span><span class="rvts6">: Source documents, along with the journal entries they support, provide an essential audit trail. This audit trail allows accountants and auditors to trace and verify the accuracy and completeness of transactions recorded in the accounting system. It serves as supporting documentation for financial statements and facilitates reconciliation and analysis.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">By incorporating source documents into the accounting process and maintaining organized and accurate journals, businesses can effectively track and analyse their financial transactions, ensure compliance with accounting principles, and generate reliable financial statements.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">What is the purpose of source documents and journals?&nbsp;</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The purpose of source documents and journals in accounting is to maintain an accurate and systematic record of financial transactions and events in a business. Here is a more detailed explanation of the purpose of these elements in the accounting process:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Origin of Transactions</span><span class="rvts6">: Source documents, such as invoices, receipts, bank statements and contracts, serve as the original information indicating when a financial transaction took place. These documents help to maintain a transparent trail of all financial activities.&nbsp;</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Proof of Transactions</span><span class="rvts6">: Source documents serve as proof of the actual transactions that have taken place in a business. This is important for proving income, expenses and other financial events, especially for tax purposes and financial reporting.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Ledger Entries</span><span class="rvts6">: Journals are where financial information from source documents is entered into the ledger of a business. These entries are essential to maintaining an organized and structured accounting system, such as osFinancials.&nbsp;</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Preparation of Financial Statements</span><span class="rvts6">: Source documents and journals serve as the basis for the preparation of financial statements, such as the balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement. These financial statements provide an overview of the financial health and performance of a business.&nbsp;</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Tax compliance</span><span class="rvts6">: Source documents are essential to comply with tax obligations. This includes the proof of income, expenses, and deductions required by the tax authorities to process tax applications.&nbsp;</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Decision Making and Analysis</span><span class="rvts6">: Financial information provided by source documents and journals helps managers make decisions about the financial strategy of an enterprise. This enables them to evaluate the financial performance and determine future goals.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">In a nutshell, the purpose of source documents and journals is to maintain an orderly and faithful record of financial activities, which is essential for management, financial reporting and compliance with legal requirements. These elements form the backbone of an efficient accounting process and contribute to the transparency and credibility of a company's financial information.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">What is the importance of source documents and journals?&nbsp;</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Source documents and journals play a critical role in the field of accounting, and their importance cannot be underestimated. Here are some reasons why source documents and journals are so important in accounting:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Compliance with Financial Rules and Regulations</span><span class="rvts6">: Accounting source documents, such as invoices, receipts and bank statements, serve as proof of financial transactions. These documents are essential to ensure that a business complies with the financial rules and regulations.&nbsp;</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Accurate Financial Reports</span><span class="rvts6">: Source documents are the basis on which financial reports, such as a balance sheet and an income statement, are drawn up. Journals are used to record the information from these documents in the ledger of the business. This ensures an accurate registration of financial events.&nbsp;</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Tax returns</span><span class="rvts6">: Income tax returns, Tax (VAT/GST/Sales tax) returns and other tax obligations require a careful record of income, expenses and deductions. Source documents are essential to substantiate the fidelity of this information.&nbsp;</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Financial Analysis</span><span class="rvts6">: Financial analysts and managers use source documents and journals to evaluate the financial health of a business. These documents provide a clear picture of the company's performance and financial position.&nbsp;</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Decision Making</span><span class="rvts6">: Managers use financial information provided by source documents and journals to make decisions about the future of a business. This information can help determine strategies and set financial goals.&nbsp;</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Forensic Investigation</span><span class="rvts6">: In cases of financial malpractice, fraud or corruption, source documents can play a critical role in forensic investigations. These documents serve as evidence to prove irregularities.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">In short, source documents and journals are indispensable in the world of accounting to maintain an accurate and reliable record of financial transactions. These documents not only ensure that a business meets legal requirements, but also play a central role in the management and analysis of accurate financial information.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">Journal (Batch) Feature in osFinancials</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The Batch Entry / Journal Entry feature in osFinancials provides versatile functionality for creating customized batch or journal types tailored to your specific requirements. These batch types enable structured transaction organization, ensuring precise allocation to the appropriate ledger and debtor accounts. Here's an overview of this feature:</span></p>
<ol style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Batch Types Customization</span><span class="rvts6">: In osFinancials, you can define various batch types to match your unique needs. While many Sets of Books and templates include standard basic batches like sales journal, purchase journal, payments journal, receipts journal, and general journals (accessible through the "</span><a class="rvts34" href="create-books-default-download.html">Let osFinancials help you to create a Set of Books?</a><span class="rvts6">" option), osFinancials allows unlimited specific batch types. Examples of specialise journals, include Payroll journals, Depreciation journals, Fixed assets journals, Accrual journals, or any custom type necessary. Each batch type is designed for specific transaction categories or sets of related transactions, granting precise control over your accounting processes.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Batch / Journal Configuration</span><span class="rvts6">: The Batch Entry / Journal Entry feature offers options to configure settings, reducing errors during batch transaction entry and processing: Journal configuration: The </span><a class="rvts33" href="batch-setup-standard-tab.html">Standard tab</a><span class="rvts6"> and </span><a class="rvts33" href="batch-setup-advanced-tab.html">Advanced tab</a><span class="rvts6"> in the "</span><span class="rvts15">Options for this batch</span><span class="rvts6">" offer several options to configure default settings such as the default Contra account, Tax (VAT/GST/Sales tax) settings and other parameters for each type of journal. Configuring these settings, which reduce errors when processing transactions in journals:</span></li>
</ol>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: disc;">
 <ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 48px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: circle;">
  <li class="rvps10 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Contra Account</span><span class="rvts6">: Assign each batch (journal) to a specific contra account for easy identification and assignment of transactions to the corresponding contra account. This account will be the balancing account. When you </span><a class="rvts33" href="batch-balance.html">balance the batch</a><span class="rvts6">, the contra transactions will be generated to this contra account in the journal.</span></li>
  <li class="rvps10 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Lookup Accounts Configuration</span><span class="rvts6">: You can set a journal so that you can select all accounts for the general ledger, debtors, creditors or only accounts for the general ledger or only debtors or only creditors in the journal. So for example, in the Sales journal you can choose to list only the debtor accounts in the Lookup and can choose when you enter invoices in the Sales journal. This speeds up the allocation of transactions so that only the relevant account type can be listed and selected.</span></li>
 </ul>
</ul>
<ol style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
 <li value="3" class="rvps2 noindent"><a class="rvts32" href="open-item-link.html">Open Item Transactions</a><span class="rvts6">: This is particularly useful for matching receipts or payments transactions with outstanding amounts. When you allocate transactions against open item accounts, you can choose to link the transactions against outstanding transactions. Link specific transactions to open item accounts for extra accuracy. This is especially useful for linking receipts or payment transactions with outstanding amounts. For example, when a payment is received from a debtor, you can assign the payment to a specific outstanding invoice.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><a class="rvts32" href="batch-repeating-transactions.html">Repeating Transactions</a><span class="rvts6">: The Repeating transactions feature allows you to enter transactions occurring on a periodic basis (weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually, etc.). Enter transactions once in the </span><span class="rvts14">Edit → Repeating transactions</span><span class="rvts6"> menu and, when due, process them into the standard batch, edit (if amounts have changed), delete, or add an entry. This time-saving feature simplifies recurring transaction handling.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Export and Import Feature</span><span class="rvts6">: Export posted or unposted batches using delimited file options. osFinancials5 also supports Spreadsheet export and Spreadsheet Import options for batch transactions:</span></li>
</ol>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: disc;">
 <ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 48px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: circle;">
  <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Posted Batches</span><span class="rvts6">: Use the "</span><a class="rvts33" href="batch-import-a-posted-batch.html">Import a posted batch</a><span class="rvts6">" option (</span><span class="rvts14">F9:Process</span><span class="rvts6">) of the "</span><span class="rvts15">Batch entry</span><span class="rvts6">" screen to select a posted batch on the Posted batches tab for import.</span></li>
  <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Spreadsheet Import/Export</span><span class="rvts6">: osFinancials5 supports Excel Workbook (*.xlsx) file type Spreadsheet import and export features. You can </span><a class="rvts33" href="batch-export-excel.html">export unposted batch transactions and save them as Excel Workbook files</a><span class="rvts6">, or </span><a class="rvts33" href="batch-import-excel.html">import batch transactions from saved Excel Workbook files</a><span class="rvts6">.</span></li>
  <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Unposted Batches</span><span class="rvts6">: Export batch transactions using the "</span><a class="rvts33" href="batch-export-write-delimited-fil.html">Write delimited file</a><span class="rvts6">" option (</span><span class="rvts14">F9:Process</span><span class="rvts6">) to create a Comma Separated Value (.csv) file. Import batch transactions via the "</span><a class="rvts33" href="batch-import-delimited-fille.html">Delimited file import</a><span class="rvts6">" option (</span><span class="rvts14">F9:Process</span><span class="rvts6">) by selecting the Comma Separated file (.csv) file.</span></li>
 </ul>
</ul>
<ol style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
 <li value="6" class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Ledger Updates</span><span class="rvts6">: You don't need to </span><a class="rvts33" href="batch-post.html">post or update transactions in batches</a><span class="rvts6"> every time. Close a batch and reopen it as needed to add or edit transactions. When finalizing batch processing and posting to the ledger, osFinancials automatically updates ledger accounts, including debtor and creditor accounts where applicable. This ensures financial statements, such as the trial balance, balance sheet and the income statement including relevant reports accurately include and reflect these transactions.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">By utilizing the Batch Entry / Journal Entry feature in osFinancials, you can efficiently manage and allocate transactions across various batch types, maintaining accurate and up-to-date accounting records with precision.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">Which journals (batches) is included in osFinancials template Sets of Books?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">In osFinancials, the template Sets of Books include various subsidiary journals or books of prime entry (also known as batches) to facilitate the recording and summarization of transaction details. These journals help ensure accurate and organized financial data. Here are the subsidiary journals typically included in osFinancials template Sets of Books:</span></p>
<ol style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside;">

<ol style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Default journals</span><span class="rvts6">: osFinancials comes with a range of default journal types, including the sales journal, purchase journal, general journal, payments journals, and receipt journals.

<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">There are many different types of journals, including the general journal, sales journal, purchase journal, and cash receipts journal.

<p class="rvps19"><span class="rvts30">Before you can record your transactions in a batch, you'll need to organise your source documents by transaction type.

<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">What is the general journal used for?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The general journal is a book or computer program used in accounting to record all transactions in chronological order. It is also known as the "journal" or "journal entry book".</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Each transaction recorded in the general journal includes a date, a brief description of the transaction, the accounts involved, and the amounts debited or credited. These transactions are then later transferred to the appropriate ledgers for posting and summarization.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The general journal is used to record a wide range of transactions, such as sales, purchases, expenses, and other financial transactions. It is also used to record adjusting entries and closing entries at the end of an accounting period.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">By recording all transactions in the general journal, a business can keep a complete and accurate record of its financial activities. This information is then used to prepare financial statements and to analyze the financial performance of the business. The general journal is an essential tool for any business that wants to maintain accurate financial records and make informed decisions about its financial activities.</span></p>

   <p class="rvps12"><span class="rvts40">The Activa plugin in osFinancials allows you to register fixed assets that need to be written off. The write-off process occurs over the lifespan of the asset and can be spread across multiple financial years.</span></p>

   <p class="rvps12"><span class="rvts40">As you record the depreciation expenses for each financial year, they will be reported in the income statement and reduce your net profit.

   <p class="rvps12"><span class="rvts40">The Activa plugin's powerful grid, custom filtering options, and integrated pivot tables enhance the search and analysis capabilities for active fixed assets, assets requiring processing, and transaction details. The Ledger analyser allows for the printing and exporting of the trial balance, income statement, and balance sheet, while the T-Account viewer facilitates the export of transactions to spreadsheets.</span></p>

<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">When entering and processing transactions in journals or batches, there are typically seven steps involved. These steps ensure accurate data entry, balancing, and posting to the ledger. Here is a breakdown of each step:</span></p>
<ol style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Set the options or defaults for the batch</span><span class="rvts6">: Before entering transactions, you may need to configure certain options or defaults for the batch. This could include setting the default currency, account codes, or any other relevant parameters. This step is typically done once, unless there are changes in your requirements.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Enter the alias (name for the batch)</span><span class="rvts6">: Assign a name or alias to the batch to help identify it later when generating reports or exporting/importing data. This allows for easy reference and organisation of your batches.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Select VAT/GST/Sales Tax treatment</span><span class="rvts6">: If your transactions are subject to VAT/GST/Sales Tax, specify whether they are inclusive or exclusive of these taxes. This ensures accurate tax calculations and reporting. If no tax is applicable to the transactions, this option can be skipped.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Enter the transactions in the batch</span><span class="rvts6">: Input the transaction details into the batch. This involves capturing the relevant information from source documents, such as invoices or receipts, and entering it into the appropriate fields in the batch. Ensure accuracy and completeness during data entry.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Balance the batch</span><span class="rvts6">: Once all transactions are entered, ensure that the batch is balanced. This means the total debits and credits in the batch should match. Balancing the batch is crucial to maintaining accurate financial records and identifying any data entry errors.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">List the batch and retain the batch listing</span><span class="rvts6">: Generate a listing of the transactions within the batch and retain it along with the source documents. This serves as a record of the transactions entered and aids in reconciling the data at a later stage.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Post the batch to the ledger</span><span class="rvts6">: The final step is to post the batch to the appropriate ledger accounts. This action updates the accounts with the transaction data and ensures the financial records are accurate and up to date. Posting transfers the information from the batch to the general ledger for proper accounting.</span></li>

   <p class="rvps19"><span class="rvts210">In osFinancials, you have the flexibility to enter and capture transactions without immediately posting the batch to the ledger. This allows you to capture transactions on a daily basis and exit the batch screen, proceeding to steps 5 and 7 at a later time. The data will be saved within the batch, ensuring it is not lost and can be balanced and posted at a more convenient time.</span></p>
