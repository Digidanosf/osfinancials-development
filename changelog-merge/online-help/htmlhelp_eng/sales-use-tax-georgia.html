<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">As of ChatGPT's last update in September 2021, here are some key points about the tax system in Georgia:</span></p>
<ol style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Sales Tax</span><span class="rvts6">: Georgia imposes a state-level sales tax on the retail sale of tangible personal property and certain services. The general state sales tax rate is 4%. In addition to the state sales tax, some local jurisdictions may impose additional sales taxes, resulting in varying total sales tax rates in different areas of the state.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Use Tax</span><span class="rvts6">: Georgia also has a use tax, which is applied when tangible personal property is purchased out-of-state and brought into Georgia for use, storage, or consumption. If sales tax was not paid at the time of purchase, the purchaser owes use tax on the value of the property.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Individual Income Tax</span><span class="rvts6">: Georgia levies an individual income tax on residents and non-residents who earn income in the state. The state has a graduated income tax system with six tax brackets and rates ranging from 1% to 5.75% based on income levels.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Corporate Income Tax</span><span class="rvts6">: Georgia imposes a corporate income tax on corporations conducting business in the state. The corporate tax rates vary depending on the company's taxable income.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Franchise Tax</span><span class="rvts6">: Georgia imposes an annual corporate net worth tax, also known as a franchise tax, on corporations registered in the state.

 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Property Taxes</span><span class="rvts6">: Georgia imposes property taxes on real property, such as land and buildings. Property tax rates are determined at the local level and can vary by county.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Vehicle Taxes and Fees</span><span class="rvts6">: Georgia imposes various taxes and fees on motor vehicles, including sales tax on vehicle purchases, ad valorem taxes based on the vehicle's value, and annual registration fees.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Excise Taxes</span><span class="rvts6">: Georgia imposes excise taxes on certain products, such as alcohol, tobacco, and motor fuel.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Estate Tax</span><span class="rvts6">: Georgia does not have its own estate tax. Additionally, it does not have a "pick-up" tax, meaning it does not collect a portion of the federal estate tax paid by the estate.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Local Option Sales Tax</span><span class="rvts6">: Some counties in Georgia may impose a Local Option Sales Tax (LOST) or Special Purpose Local Option Sales Tax (SPLOST) for specific projects or local funding needs.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">No Local Income Tax</span><span class="rvts6">: Georgia does not allow local jurisdictions to impose their own income taxes.</span></li>
</ol>

 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Sales Tax Rate</span><span class="rvts6">: The state sales tax rate in Georgia is 4%. However, some local jurisdictions (counties and cities) may impose additional local sales taxes, which means the total sales tax rate can be higher in certain areas.

 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Exemptions</span><span class="rvts6">: Some items and services may be exempt from Georgia's sales tax. Common exemptions include prescription drugs, groceries, certain medical equipment, and sales to tax-exempt organizations.</span></li>

The purchaser is then responsible for paying the corresponding use tax directly to the state.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Filing and Payment</span><span class="rvts6">: Individuals and businesses in Georgia are required to report and remit use tax on their state income tax return if they made purchases without paying sales tax. This typically applies to out-of-state purchases, internet purchases, and other transactions where sales tax was not collected at the time of purchase.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Online Purchases</span><span class="rvts6">: As mentioned above, use tax in Georgia is relevant to out-of-state purchases and online purchases where sales tax was not collected.
