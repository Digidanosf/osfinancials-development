 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Impact on Financial Analysis and Decision-Making</span><span class="rvts6">: The R&amp;D section should conclude by discussing how these complexities influence financial analysis and decision-making. It should emphasize the need for accurate, consistent, and transparent financial reporting practices to enable meaningful comparisons and informed business decisions in a global context.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Financial Analysis and Valuation</span><span class="rvts6">: Explore the methodologies and techniques used in financial analysis and valuation, including ratio analysis, discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, and market comparable analysis.
