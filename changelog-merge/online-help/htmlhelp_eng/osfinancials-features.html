<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The Batch Entry / Journal Entry feature in osFinancials provides versatile functionality for creating customized batch or journal types tailored to your specific requirements. These batch types enable structured transaction organization, ensuring precise allocation to the appropriate ledger and debtor accounts. Here's an overview of this feature:</span></p>
<ol style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Batch Types Customization</span><span class="rvts6">: In osFinancials, you can define various batch types to match your unique needs. While many Sets of Books and templates include standard basic batches like sales journal, purchase journal, payments journal, receipts journal, and general journals (accessible through the "</span><a class="rvts34" href="create-books-default-download.html">Let osFinancials help you to create a Set of Books?</a><span class="rvts6">" option), osFinancials allows unlimited specific batch types. Examples of specialise journals, include Payroll journals, Depreciation journals, Fixed assets journals, Accrual journals, or any custom type necessary. Each batch type is designed for specific transaction categories or sets of related transactions, granting precise control over your accounting processes.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Batch / Journal Configuration</span><span class="rvts6">: The Batch Entry / Journal Entry feature offers options to configure settings, reducing errors during batch transaction entry and processing: Journal configuration: The </span><a class="rvts33" href="batch-setup-standard-tab.html">Standard tab</a><span class="rvts6"> and </span><a class="rvts33" href="batch-setup-advanced-tab.html">Advanced tab</a><span class="rvts6"> in the "</span><span class="rvts15">Options for this batch</span><span class="rvts6">" offer several options to configure default settings such as the default Contra account, Tax (VAT/GST/Sales tax) settings and other parameters for each type of journal. Configuring these settings, which reduce errors when processing transactions in journals:</span></li>
</ol>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: disc;">
 <ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 48px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: circle;">
  <li class="rvps10 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Contra Account</span><span class="rvts6">: Assign each batch (journal) to a specific contra account for easy identification and assignment of transactions to the corresponding contra account. This account will be the balancing account. When you </span><a class="rvts33" href="batch-balance.html">balance the batch</a><span class="rvts6">, the contra transactions will be generated to this contra account in the journal.</span></li>
  <li class="rvps10 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Lookup Accounts Configuration</span><span class="rvts6">: You can set a journal so that you can select all accounts for the general ledger, debtors, creditors or only accounts for the general ledger or only debtors or only creditors in the journal. So for example, in the Sales journal you can choose to list only the debtor accounts in the Lookup and can choose when you enter invoices in the Sales journal. This speeds up the allocation of transactions so that only the relevant account type can be listed and selected.</span></li>
 </ul>
</ul>
<ol style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
 <li value="3" class="rvps2 noindent"><a class="rvts32" href="open-item-link.html">Open Item Transactions</a><span class="rvts6">: This is particularly useful for matching receipts or payments transactions with outstanding amounts. When you allocate transactions against open item accounts, you can choose to link the transactions against outstanding transactions. Link specific transactions to open item accounts for extra accuracy. This is especially useful for linking receipts or payment transactions with outstanding amounts. For example, when a payment is received from a debtor, you can assign the payment to a specific outstanding invoice.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><a class="rvts32" href="batch-repeating-transactions.html">Repeating Transactions</a><span class="rvts6">: The Repeating transactions feature allows you to enter transactions occurring on a periodic basis (weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually, etc.). Enter transactions once in the </span><span class="rvts14">Edit → Repeating transactions</span><span class="rvts6"> menu and, when due, process them into the standard batch, edit (if amounts have changed), delete, or add an entry. This time-saving feature simplifies recurring transaction handling.</span></li>

 </ul>
</ul>
<ol style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
 <li value="6" class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Ledger Updates</span><span class="rvts6">: You don't need to </span><a class="rvts33" href="batch-post.html">post or update transactions in batches</a><span class="rvts6"> every time. Close a batch and reopen it as needed to add or edit transactions. When finalizing batch processing and posting to the ledger, osFinancials automatically updates ledger accounts, including debtor and creditor accounts where applicable. This ensures financial statements, such as the trial balance, balance sheet and the income statement including relevant reports accurately include and reflect these transactions.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">By utilizing the Batch Entry / Journal Entry feature in osFinancials, you can efficiently manage and allocate transactions across various batch types, maintaining accurate and up-to-date accounting records with precision.</span></p>
<h2 class="rvps4"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts45">Open item processing&nbsp;</span></span></h2>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts30">The </span><a class="rvts74" href="open-item-link.html">Open item processing</a><span class="rvts30"> feature in osFinancials </span><span class="rvts6">is a method used in accounting and financial management to track and manage outstanding or unresolved transactions, often referred to as open items.

For example, matching a customer payment with an outstanding invoice or reconciling a bank statement with recorded transactions. This helps identify and resolve discrepancies or differences between recorded transactions and actual financial records.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Ageing Analysis</span><span class="rvts6">: The module provides ageing analysis functionality, allowing users to categorize and analyse open items based on their age or duration since the transaction occurred.

<ol style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">PDF (Portable Document Format):</span><span class="rvts6"> PDF is a widely used file format that preserves the formatting, fonts, and layout of a document. It ensures that the recipient sees the document exactly as intended, regardless of their software or operating system. PDF files are typically read-only, allowing recipients to view and print the document but not easily edit its content. Sending documents as PDF attachments guarantees compatibility and easy viewing for recipients.</span></li>

UBL 2.1 is a specific version of the UBL standard. UBL files follow a predefined structure and contain structured information about various business documents such as invoices, purchase orders, and payment instructions. UBL files are commonly used in business-to-business (B2B) transactions to facilitate automated processing and interoperability between different software systems. By sending documents as UBL 2.1 attachments, you provide recipients with machine-readable data that can be easily processed by their business systems.</span></li>
</ol>
