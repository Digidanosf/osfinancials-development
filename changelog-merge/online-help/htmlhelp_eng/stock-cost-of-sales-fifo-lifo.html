<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Before initiating any document processing in osFinancials, it is crucial to ensure that all settings pertaining to Stock items, Cost of sales, and Documents are accurately configured.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">Cost price setting and calculation of Cost of Sales</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">During the initial setup of your Set of Books, it is essential to either input a purchase transaction or conduct a stock take-on for each stock item before entering any invoices. This step allows osFinancials to capture the cost price of each stock item. The cost price plays a vital role in updating the Cost of sales and Stock accounts when an invoice is generated. Failing to provide a cost price will result in the Cost of sales account being updated with a zero amount, which can lead to an inflated gross profit figure.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">It is imperative that the required accounts and settings are properly configured before engaging in purchasing and selling activities involving trading stock items within your Set of Books. Neglecting this step may yield inaccurate results in osFinancials, such as missing Cost of sales transactions upon posting to the ledger or incorrect calculation of the cost of sales using average cost instead of the latest cost.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The selection between using "</span><span class="rvts15">average cost</span><span class="rvts6">" or "</span><span class="rvts15">latest cost</span><span class="rvts6">" is a critical setting that significantly impacts the valuation of your stock. If you are uncertain about which method to choose, it is advisable to consult with your accountant, as the value assigned to your stock can have implications on your profit and loss figures.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">Cost of sales - Using "average cost" or "latest cost" setting</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Cost of sales - Using "</span><span class="rvts15">average cost</span><span class="rvts6">" or "</span><span class="rvts15">latest cost</span><span class="rvts6">" is a critical setting that you may take note of when following the accounting framework and standard e.g. GAAP, IFRS full, IFRS for SMEs depending on the jurisdiction</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Indeed, the choice between using "</span><span class="rvts15">average cost</span><span class="rvts6">" or "</span><span class="rvts15">latest cost</span><span class="rvts6">" for calculating the Cost of sales is an important decision that should align with the applicable accounting framework and standards, such as GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles), IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) full, or IFRS for SMEs (Small and Medium-sized Enterprises), depending on the jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Different accounting frameworks may have specific guidelines regarding the valuation of inventory and determining the cost to be allocated to the Cost of sales. These guidelines aim to ensure consistency, accuracy, and comparability in financial reporting.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">To adhere to the appropriate accounting framework and standard, it is advisable to consult with your accountant or financial advisor. They can provide guidance on selecting the most suitable cost calculation method (average cost or latest cost) based on the specific requirements of your jurisdiction and the nature of your business operations.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">In which accounting standard is average cost or latest cost followed?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Both average cost and latest cost can be used as cost calculation methods for inventory valuation and Cost of sales in various accounting standards. The choice between these methods depends on the specific requirements and principles outlined in each accounting standard. Here are some examples:</span></p>
<ol style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)</span><span class="rvts6">: Under GAAP, both average cost and latest cost methods can be used. The specific application may vary depending on the country and the relevant accounting principles adopted within that jurisdiction.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)</span><span class="rvts6">: IFRS provides guidelines for inventory valuation but does not prescribe a specific cost calculation method. Entities following IFRS have the flexibility to choose between average cost and latest cost based on their specific circumstances and the requirements of the standard.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">It's important to note that the choice of cost calculation method should be consistent and applied in a manner that faithfully represents the financial position and performance of the company. It is recommended to consult with a qualified accountant or financial professional to determine the appropriate cost method based on the applicable accounting standards and the specific requirements of your business.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">Is the use of average cost and latest cost related to FIFO and LIFO?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Yes, the use of average cost and latest cost can be related to the inventory valuation methods of FIFO (First-In, First-Out) and LIFO (Last-In, First-Out).</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts14">FIFO</span><span class="rvts6"> assumes that the first items purchased or produced are the first ones sold. Under FIFO, the cost of inventory sold is based on the oldest or earliest purchases, while the ending inventory is valued at the most recent purchases. This generally results in the Cost of sales being calculated using the oldest cost prices, which may be considered similar to the average cost method.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts14">LIFO</span><span class="rvts6">, on the other hand, assumes that the last items purchased or produced are the first ones sold. Under LIFO, the cost of inventory sold is based on the most recent purchases, while the ending inventory is valued at the oldest or earliest purchases. This generally results in the Cost of sales being calculated using the most recent cost prices, which may be considered similar to the latest cost method.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">While average cost and latest cost methods are not strictly defined by the FIFO or LIFO principles, they can align with the cost flow assumptions used in these methods. Average cost represents an average of all costs incurred, while latest cost represents the most recent cost incurred.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">It's important to note that the use of FIFO and LIFO, as well as the choice between average cost and latest cost, may be subject to specific accounting regulations and requirements in different jurisdictions. It's advisable to consult with a qualified accountant or financial professional to determine the appropriate inventory valuation method based on the applicable accounting standards and regulations in your specific region.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">Is the use of average cost related to FIFO or LIFO?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The use of average cost is not directly related to either FIFO (First-In, First-Out) or LIFO (Last-In, First-Out). Average cost is a separate inventory valuation method that calculates the cost of inventory as an average of the costs of all items in stock.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Under the average cost method, the cost of inventory is determined by dividing the total cost of goods available for sale by the total number of units available for sale. This average cost per unit is then used to value both the Cost of sales and the ending inventory.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">In contrast, FIFO assumes that the first items purchased or produced are the first ones sold, while LIFO assumes that the last items purchased or produced are the first ones sold. Both FIFO and LIFO methods assign specific costs to the inventory based on the order of acquisition or production.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">While average cost can provide a smoothed and consistent valuation for inventory, it is not tied to the specific flow assumptions of FIFO or LIFO. The choice between average cost, FIFO, or LIFO depends on factors such as the nature of the business, industry practices, applicable accounting standards, and regulatory requirements.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">Is the use of latest cost related to FIFO or LIFO?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The use of the latest cost method is more closely related to the LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) inventory valuation method.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Under the LIFO method, the assumption is that the most recently acquired or produced items are the first ones sold. Therefore, when calculating the cost of goods sold, the cost assigned to each unit is based on the most recent cost of acquiring or producing inventory. This approach can result in a better reflection of current market prices and cost changes.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">In the context of the latest cost method, the cost assigned to inventory is based on the most recent or latest cost incurred to acquire or produce the items. This method allows for greater responsiveness to changes in the cost of inventory, as it values the inventory based on the most up-to-date costs. This can be particularly useful in industries where the cost of inventory fluctuates frequently.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">While there is a relationship between the use of the latest cost method and the LIFO inventory valuation method, it's important to note that they are not interchangeable. The LIFO method involves specific assumptions and requirements for inventory accounting, including the need to maintain detailed records of the order of acquisition or production. The use of the latest cost method, on the other hand, focuses on valuing inventory based on the most recent costs incurred without necessarily adhering to the strict LIFO requirements.</span><span class="rvts6"></span></p>
