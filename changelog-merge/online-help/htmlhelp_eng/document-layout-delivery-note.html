<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">What is a delivery note?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">A delivery note, also known as a delivery receipt or packing slip, is a document used in the shipping and logistics industry to confirm the delivery of goods from a seller or supplier to a buyer or customer. It serves as a record of the items that have been delivered, their quantities, and their condition at the time of delivery. Here are some key points about a delivery note:</span></p>
<ol style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Contents</span><span class="rvts6">: A delivery note typically includes information such as the names and addresses of the sender (supplier) and the recipient (buyer), a list of the items being delivered along with their descriptions and quantities, any special handling instructions, and any additional notes relevant to the delivery.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Purpose</span><span class="rvts6">: The primary purpose of a delivery note is to provide both the sender and the recipient with a record of the goods that have been shipped and received. It acts as proof of delivery and can be used to resolve any disputes or discrepancies that might arise regarding the delivered items.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Reference</span><span class="rvts6">: Often, a delivery note will include a reference number or code that can be used to cross-reference the delivery with corresponding sales orders, purchase orders, invoices, and other related documents.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Internal and External Use</span><span class="rvts6">: Delivery notes are used internally within the shipping and receiving departments of a company to ensure that the correct items are dispatched and received. They are also provided to the recipient to assist with inventory management and quality control.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Legal and Financial Implications</span><span class="rvts6">: Delivery notes may have legal and financial implications. For instance, they can be used as evidence in cases where disputes arise over the condition, quantity, or timeliness of a delivery. They can also be used by the recipient to check against their purchase orders and invoices to ensure accurate billing.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Variations</span><span class="rvts6">: The specific format and information included in a delivery note can vary based on the industry, company policies, and local regulations. Some businesses may choose to include additional details such as batch numbers, serial numbers, barcodes, and more.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">In summary, a delivery note is an essential document that helps ensure the smooth flow of goods between suppliers and customers. It provides a clear record of what has been delivered, aiding in accuracy, accountability, and transparency in business transactions.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">Exclude / Include prices in a delivery note</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">It is a common practice to exclude prices from a delivery note, particularly for security and confidentiality reasons. Including prices on a delivery note can have several potential drawbacks:</span></p>
<ol style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Confidentiality</span><span class="rvts6">: Prices can be sensitive information, and sharing them on a delivery note could potentially expose sensitive financial details to unintended recipients, such as third-party logistics providers, warehouse staff, or even competitors.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Customer Relations</span><span class="rvts6">: If a delivery note with prices falls into the hands of the recipient's customers or clients, it might cause confusion, privacy concerns, or even harm the business relationship by revealing pricing agreements.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Theft and Fraud Prevention</span><span class="rvts6">: Excluding prices from delivery notes can help reduce the risk of theft and fraud. If unauthorized individuals gain access to delivery notes with prices, they might exploit the information for illicit purposes.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Data Protection</span><span class="rvts6">: Many countries have data protection regulations that require businesses to handle personal and sensitive data with care. Exposing pricing information unnecessarily could potentially violate these regulations.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Focus on Delivery</span><span class="rvts6">: Delivery notes are primarily used to confirm the receipt of goods and their condition. Excluding prices allows both the sender and the recipient to focus on verifying the accuracy of the items received rather than getting distracted by financial details.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">While excluding prices is a common practice, it's essential to ensure that the delivery note contains enough information for the recipient to accurately verify the delivered items. Including details such as references, item codes, descriptions, quantities, unit measurements, and any relevant comments is crucial for efficient inventory management and reconciliation.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Ultimately, the decision to include or exclude prices on a delivery note should be based on your business's specific policies, industry norms, and the need to balance security and transparency in your business operations.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">Delivery notes is usually sent to customers and to creditors for returns</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Sending delivery notes to both customers and creditors for returns is a common practice in business transactions. Here's how the process typically works:</span></p>
<ol style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Debtors (Customers/Clients)</span><span class="rvts6">:</span></li>
</ol>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: disc;">
 <ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 48px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: circle;">
  <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Outgoing Deliveries</span><span class="rvts6">: When you send products to customers, you provide them with a delivery note along with the shipment. The delivery note contains details about the items being delivered, their quantities, descriptions, and any other relevant information.</span></li>
  <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Returns</span><span class="rvts6">: If a customer wants to return items to you, they would typically include a copy of the delivery note that was sent with the original shipment. This helps you verify the returned items against the original delivery and ensures accuracy in the return process.</span></li>
 </ul>
</ul>
<ol style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
 <li value="2" class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Creditors (Suppliers/Vendors)</span><span class="rvts6">:</span></li>
</ol>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: disc;">
 <ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 48px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: circle;">
  <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Incoming Deliveries</span><span class="rvts6">: When you receive goods from your suppliers or vendors, they might send a delivery note along with the shipment. This note provides you with information about the items you've received, quantities, descriptions, and potentially other details like batch numbers.</span></li>
  <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Returns to Suppliers</span><span class="rvts6">: If you need to return items to your suppliers due to defects, errors, or other reasons, you can include a copy of the original delivery note (if available) to indicate the items being returned and their quantities. This helps the supplier process the return efficiently.</span></li>
 </ul>
</ul>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">In both cases, the primary purpose of the delivery note is to ensure transparency and accuracy in the movement of goods. Including essential details like references, item codes, descriptions, quantities, and any relevant comments ensures that both parties have clear records of the transactions.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">While it's common to exclude prices from delivery notes to maintain security and confidentiality, the exact content and format of the delivery notes can vary based on your business's practices and industry norms. The key is to provide enough information for easy verification and processing of shipments and returns while protecting sensitive information.</span></p>
