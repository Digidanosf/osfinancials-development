<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">Depreciation : Accounting standards and Accounting method</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Depreciation is applicable to both small and medium entities (SMEs) and larger entities following International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), including IFRS (full) and IFRS for SMEs.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Under IFRS (full) and IFRS for SMEs, entities are required to account for depreciation of their tangible assets. Depreciation is considered an important aspect of financial reporting as it helps to accurately present the financial position and performance of an entity by allocating the cost of assets over their useful lives.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">As for the accounting method, depreciation is primarily associated with the accrual-based accounting method. In accrual accounting, expenses are recognized when incurred, and revenues are recognized when earned, regardless of the timing of cash flows. Depreciation is recorded as an expense over the asset's useful life, even if the cash outflow for the asset's acquisition occurred in a different accounting period.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">On the other hand, the cash-based accounting method does not typically involve the recognition of depreciation. Cash-based accounting recognizes revenues and expenses when cash is received or paid, respectively, rather than when they are earned or incurred. Since depreciation is a non-cash expense, it is not recognized in the cash-based accounting method.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">However, it's important to note that entities following the cash-based accounting method may still be required to account for depreciation for taxation purposes or for other reporting needs outside of their cash-based financial statements.</span></p>

   <p class="rvps12"><span class="rvts40">The Activa plugin automates the management and processes of fixed assets and the depreciation of fixed assets in your accounts over the lifespan of the fixed assets. &nbsp;Periodically you will receive a notification screen, which the depreciation shown. From this screen, the depreciation(s) can directly take place. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
   <p class="rvps12"><span class="rvts40">The Activa plugin in osFinancials allows you to register fixed assets that need to be written off. The write-off process occurs over the lifespan of the asset and can be spread across multiple financial years.</span></p>
   <p class="rvps12"><span class="rvts40">By adding the Activa Fixed asset accounts in the plugin setup, you will receive reminders when new transactions are posted to the ledger or when Activa transactions require processing. This automation streamlines the management of depreciation allowances for fixed assets (tangible assets) in your Set of Books over the asset's lifespan.</span></p>
   <p class="rvps12"><span class="rvts40">As you record the depreciation expenses for each financial year, they will be reported in the income statement and reduce your net profit. Additionally, the plugin will provide you with the net value of your fixed assets, which is calculated as the fixed assets' cost minus the accumulated depreciation, and this information will be reflected in the balance sheet.</span></p>
   <p class="rvps12"><span class="rvts40">In summary, the Activa plugin helps automate the depreciation management process, ensures accurate reporting of depreciation expenses, and provides visibility into the net value of fixed assets over their lifespan in both the income statement and the balance sheet.</span></p>
   <p class="rvps12"><span class="rvts40">When a fixed asset reached the end of life end process that will clear of the total write-off from the balance write-off account and the initial asset account. This will display only the remaining total on the asset account and the contra account the will be cleared of this total.</span></p>
   <p class="rvps12"><span class="rvts40">By allowing the write-off process to occur over the lifespan of the asset and providing reminders for transaction processing, the plugin further streamlines the management of depreciation allowances for fixed assets.</span></p>
   <p class="rvps12"><span class="rvts40">The accurate reporting of depreciation expenses in the income statement and the reflection of the net value of fixed assets (cost minus accumulated depreciation) in the balance sheet remain essential features of the plugin.</span></p>
   <p class="rvps12"><span class="rvts40">Furthermore, the ability to clear the total write-off from the balance write-off account and the initial asset account when a fixed asset reaches the end of its life adds to the efficiency of the process.</span></p>
   <p class="rvps12"><span class="rvts40">The Activa plugin's powerful grid, custom filtering options, and integrated pivot tables enhance the search and analysis capabilities for active fixed assets, assets requiring processing, and transaction details. The Ledger analyser allows for the printing and exporting of the trial balance, income statement, and balance sheet, while the T-Account viewer facilitates the export of transactions to spreadsheets.</span></p>
   <p class="rvps12"><span class="rvts40">The Central search feature in osFinancials further aids in searching for transactions related to fixed assets, providing comprehensive functionality for managing and analysing fixed asset data.</span></p>

<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">What is depreciation?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Depreciation is an accounting method used to allocate the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life. It represents the gradual decrease in the value of an asset due to factors such as wear and tear, obsolescence, or the passage of time. Depreciation is a non-cash expense, meaning it does not involve an actual outflow of cash but is recorded to reflect the decrease in the asset's value over time.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Depreciation is important in financial reporting as it helps to match the cost of an asset with the revenue it generates during its useful life. By spreading the cost over multiple accounting periods, depreciation allows businesses to reflect the consumption of the asset's value in the periods it is used to generate revenue.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">There are various methods for calculating depreciation, including straight-line depreciation, declining balance depreciation, and units of production depreciation. The choice of depreciation method depends on factors such as the nature of the asset, its expected useful life, and applicable accounting standards.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">It's worth noting that depreciation is primarily applicable to tangible assets such as buildings, vehicles, machinery, equipment, and furniture. Intangible assets, such as patents or trademarks, are subject to a similar concept called amortization.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">Is Depreciation a long-term adjustment?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Depreciation is a long-term adjustment. It involves allocating the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life. The purpose of depreciation is to recognize the gradual wear and tear, obsolescence, or decrease in the asset's value over time. By spreading the cost of the asset over its useful life, depreciation helps to match the expense of using the asset with the revenues it generates.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Since depreciation is related to the usage of long-term assets, it is considered a long-term adjustment. It affects the financial statements over multiple accounting periods, reflecting the ongoing consumption of the asset's economic benefits. The accumulated depreciation is typically presented as a contra-asset account on the balance sheet, reducing the carrying value of the related asset.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Depreciation is important for accurately reporting an entity's financial position and profitability, as it recognizes the cost of utilizing long-term assets in generating revenue. It is a key component in determining the true cost and value of an entity's assets and impacts various financial ratios, such as return on assets and net income.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">What accounts is required to record and manage depreciation?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">To record and manage depreciation, the following accounts are typically used:</span></p>
<ol style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Accumulated Depreciation</span><span class="rvts6">: This is a contra-asset account that is used to accumulate the total depreciation expense recognized on an asset over its useful life. It is presented on the balance sheet and reduces the carrying value of the related asset.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Depreciation Expense</span><span class="rvts6">: This is an expense account on the income statement that represents the periodic depreciation charge for the accounting period. It is used to record the portion of an asset's cost that is expensed during the period.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Asset Accounts</span><span class="rvts6">: Each individual asset that is subject to depreciation should have its own asset account. These accounts represent the cost or value of the asset and are typically classified as long-term assets on the balance sheet.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The recording of depreciation involves debiting the Depreciation Expense account and crediting the Accumulated Depreciation account. This allocation process continues over the useful life of the asset until the asset's carrying value is reduced to its estimated residual value.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Managing depreciation involves periodically reviewing and updating the estimated useful lives, residual values, and depreciation methods for assets. It also includes conducting periodic impairment assessments to ensure that the carrying value of the assets is not higher than their recoverable amounts.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">It's important to note that the specific accounts and procedures for recording and managing depreciation may vary based on the accounting standards followed (such as IFRS or GAAP) and the entity's internal policies and practices.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">Is Asset accounts for each Asset main account structured into sub-accounts?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">It is a common practice to use sub-accounts within the Fixed assets category in the Chart of Accounts to track the cost of the asset and the accumulated depreciation.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Typically, the main account under the Fixed assets category represents the net value or carrying value of the asset. This main account reflects the original cost of the asset minus the accumulated depreciation. It provides a snapshot of the asset's value at a specific point in time.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The sub-accounts within the Fixed assets category are used to track specific details related to the asset. In this case, the *</span><span class="rvts15">Asset at cost</span><span class="rvts6">" sub-account is used to record the original cost or value of the asset. The "Accumulated depreciation" sub-account is a contra account that is credited with the amount of depreciation expense recognized over time. By having a contra account, the net value of the asset is calculated by subtracting the accumulated depreciation from the asset's cost.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">This approach allows for better visibility and tracking of the asset's cost, accumulated depreciation, and net value. It also simplifies the process of recording depreciation expenses and provides a clear picture of the asset's value on the balance sheet.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Here's an example of how the main account and sub-accounts for motor vehicles could be structured within the Fixed Assets category in the Chart of Accounts:</span></p>
<div class="rvps2">
<table width="100%" style="border-color: #000080; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px; background-color: #ffffff; border-spacing: 0px;">

  </td>
  <td style="padding: 5px; vertical-align: top; width: 649px;">
   <p class="rvps12"><span class="rvts40">This main account "Motor Vehicles - Net Value" represents the book value or holding value of the asset and is derived by subtracting the accumulated depreciation from the asset's cost. It provides a clear reflection of the net value of the motor vehicles on the balance sheet. It consists basically of the following two sub-accounts.</span></p>

</div>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">This account structure enables proper tracking and reporting of the motor vehicles' financial information, providing insights into their historical cost, accumulated depreciation, and net value. It adheres to common accounting principles and facilitates accurate financial statements and analysis.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">By using these sub-accounts, you can track the cost of the motor vehicles, the accumulated depreciation, and the net value of the motor vehicles separately. This provides a more detailed breakdown of the motor vehicles' financial information and facilitates accurate reporting and analysis.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">It's important to note that the specific account names and structure may vary based on the organization's preferences and accounting system. Therefore, it is advisable to consult with an accounting professional or follow the established guidelines and practices in your specific accounting framework or industry.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">Depreciation - when is it recorded, annually, 6 months, 3 months or monthly?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The frequency of recording depreciation depends on the accounting policy and the specific requirements of the reporting entity. In general, depreciation is recorded periodically over the useful life of the asset. The most common frequency for recording depreciation is monthly or annually.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts14">Monthly depreciation</span><span class="rvts6">: Some businesses choose to record depreciation on a monthly basis. This approach allows for more precise allocation of the asset's cost over time and provides a more granular view of the asset's impact on the financial statements. Monthly depreciation is commonly used for assets with shorter useful lives or when more accurate tracking of depreciation expense is desired.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts14">Annual depreciation</span><span class="rvts6">: Many businesses opt to record depreciation on an annual basis. This means that the total depreciation expense for the year is recorded in a single transaction. Annual depreciation is commonly used for assets with longer useful lives or when the periodic impact of depreciation on the financial statements is considered less significant.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts14">Other frequencies</span><span class="rvts6">: In certain cases, businesses may choose to record depreciation on a different time frame, such as every six months or every three months. These alternative frequencies are less common but may be employed based on specific reporting or operational needs.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">It's important to note that the chosen frequency of depreciation should be consistent and in line with the accounting policies and practices of the entity. The frequency should also adhere to the relevant accounting standards, such as International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) or Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which provide guidance on depreciation accounting.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">This includes IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) and its specific application for small and medium-sized entities (IFRS for SMEs). IFRS for SMEs provides simplified and streamlined accounting requirements for entities that meet the definition of a small or medium-sized entity. While it contains specific provisions tailored for SMEs, it still includes guidance on depreciation accounting. Therefore, the chosen frequency of depreciation should align with the requirements and principles outlined in IFRS for SMEs when applicable.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">It is important for entities to carefully consider and apply the relevant accounting standards, such as IFRS for SMEs, to ensure accurate and consistent financial reporting, including the recording of depreciation. Compliance with the applicable accounting standards helps maintain transparency and comparability in financial statements, which is essential for users of financial information.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts13">What transactions is required to process the procurement of a fixed asset?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">To process the procurement of a fixed asset, you would typically need to perform the following transactions:</span></p>
<ol style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Purchase of the Fixed asset</span><span class="rvts6">: Create a purchase transaction to record the acquisition of the fixed asset. This transaction includes the purchase price of the asset, any applicable taxes, transportation costs, and other directly attributable costs. Debit the Fixed asset account to increase its value and credit the appropriate Cash (bank account) or Accounts payable account (creditor/supplier account to reflect the payment made.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Recording Depreciation</span><span class="rvts6">: After the fixed asset is acquired, you need to record depreciation expense over its useful life. This transaction transfers a portion of the asset's value from the Fixed Asset account to the Accumulated depreciation account. The specific depreciation method and useful life of the asset will determine the amount of depreciation expense to be recorded periodically.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Revaluation</span><span class="rvts6">: If the fixed asset's value changes significantly over time, you may need to perform a revaluation transaction to adjust its carrying value. This transaction involves updating the Fixed asset account with the new value of the asset and adjusting the Accumulated Depreciation account accordingly.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2 noindent"><span class="rvts14">Disposal</span><span class="rvts6">: When the fixed asset is no longer in use or is sold, a disposal transaction is recorded. This transaction removes the asset's value from the Fixed asset account and its accumulated depreciation from the Accumulated Depreciation account. Any proceeds from the sale of the asset are recorded in a separate account, such as Gain on Disposal of Fixed assets or Loss on Disposal of Fixed assets.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">These transactions ensure that the procurement, depreciation, and disposal of fixed assets are accurately recorded in the financial statements, reflecting the asset's value, depreciation over time, and any changes in its carrying value.</span><span class="rvts6"></span></p>
